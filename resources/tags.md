# Importance Tagging

## Handpicked Tag

We manually assign this tag on some particular projects which we believe are of one of the highest qualities out of all. Our handpicked projects get a wider reach to the audience. These tags are given by our internal team of experts, and users can't request these tags by themselves.

## Covid19 Tag <a id="covid19"></a>

In order to empower more academic research on Covid19 \(SARS-Coronavirus\) Oversight will assign this tag to all projects related to Covid19, and depending on the quality/significance of the project, we can also either partially reduce our platform fees or even completely waive it off in accordance with our spirit of empowerment of such research. Along with that, our team members will put extra focus on marketing your project to get it funded faster than usual.

If your project is related to Covid19 please send your project details to our team by [clicking here](https://wa.me/918700523578).

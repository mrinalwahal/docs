# Best Practices



{% hint style="info" %}
These are best-practices for publishing a project. If you are looking for the best-practices guide for writing a collaboration proposal, use the link below.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="proposals.md" %}

## Title

Make sure to choose a catchy yet professional title. Avoid unnecessary words. Remember to not put flairs and disclaimers to keep the title clean and sophisticated. There are no correct or incorrect titles. There are only good and bad titles.

{% hint style="success" %}
Good Title: **Simulating quantum teleportation of data for high-speed data transfer**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Bad Title: **With this project, I will try quantum teleportation. Please fund me!**
{% endhint %}

## Objective

Explain the primary aim of your project without revealing any confidential details. Keep it below 200 words. Don't make it into a story. Simply mention what you hope to achieve at the end of the project. Also, don't confuse it with the abstract of the project or its description.

## Abstract

Give the background of your project. Explain the actual problem you are trying to solve and where does the problem stem from. The ideal word limit should be 250-300 words.

## Significance

Explain to the readers/sponsorers why is your project important. Why should it be funded in the first place? If the project solves a larger problem affecting a very high number of people, explain its domestic/national/global significance. the ideal word limit should be 250-300 words.

## Field

Simply choose whichever academic field does your project belongs to. If you can't find your field, choose "**other**". Or if you feel your field is too important, and we should give a separate choice for it for the larger good, send us an email [here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&source=mailto&su=HELP:+%5BWrite+your+subject%5D&to=incoming%2Boversight-crowdfund-11109783-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com).

## Keywords

Choose important keywords for your project. Same as when you choose them while writing a research publication for a journal. For example, if your project is on Artificial Intelligence, or more specifically Deep Learning, then your possible keywords could be: AI, Deep Learning, RNN, CNN.

Make sure to not use a lot of keywords. Keep them minimum and only the important ones.

## Description

Explain your project in detail. Mention a step by step process on how you want to achieve your target. Again, you need not mention any confidential details and keep it to surface metadata. The ideal word limit should be 300-350 words.

## Distribution of Funds

It is advisable to mention how you want to distribute your funds so that the sponsorers get a better idea of how their sponsorships will be used and where. 

For every expenditure, you mention, write a rough amount you will spend on that particular expenditure. This need not be an exact amount. Even if you are uncertain about your expenditures, you can simply write the ones you are expecting.

## Announcement

This is a unique feature. In case you want to give a special message to any visitor on your project page, you can mention it here, and it will display at the top of your research metadata and will be visible first to your reader, before any other content.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to disable the announcement simply remove the text and save it as empty.
{% endhint %}

## Project Image

This is extremely important. It is advisable you upload an image that reveals some insight into your project. For example, if your final output is some hardware, you click an image of that physical product and upload it. Or you can also upload images of some diagrams or figures that are significant to your project. 

Project images can also be carefully chosen to show the latest progress on the project to readers.

Uploading an image isn't mandatory. If you leave it blank, we'll display a default stock image on your project page.

## Affiliation

Simply mention the name of the institution your research belongs to or is being harboured under. For example: Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics \(CAIR\), Defence Research & Development Organisation. Or Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

## Data Repository

This is again extremely important. You can attach the URL of your project's data over here. For example, if your project is a software and you don't mind revealing its codebase, you can attach the link of your git repository over here.

Similarly, if you can use this to redirect the reader to any external location where your research data is stored.

It is advisable to regularly update this URL so that users can watch the latest progress on the project by visiting this link.

## Global Subscription Based Automated Donations

Oversight provides regular subscription-based donations for those who are just looking to fund some high quality scientific/academic research but do not want to go through the trouble of browsing all projects every time they want to sponsor/donate. And we donate these funds to a carefully handpicked project by our own team and send the receipt of the donation along with project details to the donor/subscriber. To choose a subscription plan please [click here](https://oversyt.now.sh/#subscribe). 

Platform fees for such subscriptions are **30% of the total donation amount** \(+ GST as applicable\) for that donation cycle. We will automatically deduct this fees before donating the funds to any project.

We take mathematical floor values on all amounts including platform fees and taxes, for easy calculations on our end.

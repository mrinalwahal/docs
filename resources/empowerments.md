# Empowerments

In order to empower individual researchers, who generally don't work under the affiliation of any institution, to continue their aspirations as researchers and to encourage them to work hard for the projects they're building, Oversight has introduced the feture of monthly subscriptions, which can be initiated by any well-wisher of the user, who truly wants the user to continue the kind of research they are doing. Any visitor on any user's profile page can activate a monthly subscription for the user.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for empowerments to work, your Funding Account \(UPI\) must be updated in your account settings, otherwise we will not be able to disburse your collected funds into your account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oversight is also not responsible for any incorrect UPI account details saved by the any user. If you \(or any user\) saved incorrect UPI details and all the user's funds got disbursed into that account, Oversight cannot be held liable and would also not be responsible for recovering the funds. Therefore, please be very careful while saving your UPI details in your account settings.

Pricing of empowerment based donations is mentioned in the pricing below at the below link.

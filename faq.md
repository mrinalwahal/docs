# FAQ

## Do others need an Oversight account to empower me?

If someone is supporting you through a "one-time empowerment," in that case they don't need to have an Oversight account. It works anonymously for everyone. 

However, if they are subscribing to your profile on a higher level for a monthly subscription, then yes - they need an Oversight account to view your exclusive content for which they are subscribing for.

## How do I enable empowerments on my profile?

1. If you haven't already, go to your account settings and complete your KYC. If you choose manual KYC, give us roughly 24 hours to approve your KYC.
2. Go to your wallet settings and save a valid funding account \(UPI\) ID.
3. Go back to account settings and enable the "empowerments" switch.
4. Go to your profile and you should see the "empower" button. Click it and share that page's url with all your well-wishers and plug it in all your social media bio to allow people who find value in your work, support you.
5. \[Optional\] Create higher subscription levels with a custom amount and custom benefits. Otherwise one-time empowerments work by default for every profile anyway.

## Why do you need KYC?

You can use all the free features without KYC, including publishing level 0 public posts, as well as make transactions on other authors' profiles for entity, be it empowerments, or payments for lectures and resources, however, to start accepting payments on your own profile you need to do the KYC due to govt regulations.

You can read detailed documentation on KYC below.

## How can I withdraw my earned funds?

Simply go to your "wallet settings" from the header, and click on "withdraw" button. It will initiate a payout to your saved funding account \(UPI\) ID in the same wallet settings \(which you can update anytime you want as well\).

And you can track your issued settlements in the "settlements" table just below your wallet settings.

You can read about our payouts policy in detail.

## I've reached the funding target on project crowd-funding. How long until I receive my funds?

Congratulations on hitting your target! If you have already scheduled the payout from the project page, then it can take up to 3-5 working days for the funds to arrive in your account, provided there are no national/bank holidays and the payment gateway is not experiencing any problems. 

Read the payouts policy for more details.

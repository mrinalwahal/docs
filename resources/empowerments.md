# Empowerments

In order to empower individual researchers, who generally don't work under the affiliation of any institution, to continue their aspirations as researchers and to encourage them to work hard for the projects they're building, Oversight has introduced the feature of monthly subscriptions, which can be initiated by any well-wisher of the user, who truly wants the user to continue the kind of research they are doing. Any visitor on any user's profile page can activate a monthly subscription for the user.

## What are they good for?

Empowerments can enable different prospects for different researchers/users at oversight.in. Some of these can be as followed:

* Empowerments can generate a monthly basic income stream for researchers who don't operate under the umbrella of any institution or aren't affiliated to any supervising/oversight organisation which may pay them for their research.
* A fresh monthly payment might hit the nail in the coffin for any researcher who may not have had enough funds to purchase some desperately required equipment which they couldn't buy to move ahead in their project/s.
* A small donation only to display your support and empathy for a researcher makes for a great empowerment to prevent them from abandoning their projects due to low motivation or decreased interest in moving forward.

Go ahead and empower the researchers you believe are doing a great service to mankind! After all, it's cheaper than a cup of Starbucks! :\)

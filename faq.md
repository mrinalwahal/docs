# FAQ

## When will I get my money?

Once you have finally **hit your funding target and provided that the project has not crossed its funding deadline**, you will get the option of withdrawing your funds from the same project page. Clicking on that option/button will generate a unique payout link, which will open up in the current browser, and will also be sent to your registered mobile and email.

In that link, you can add your bank account or UPI details, wherever you would like to receive your funds. Upon submission of that form, your payout will automatically be scheduled for our next disbursement cycle.

You can read about our payouts policy in detail.

## I've reached the target. How long until I receive my funds?

Congratulations on hitting your target! If you have already scheduled the payout from the project page, then it can take up to 3-5 working days for the funds to arrive in your account, provided there are no national/bank holidays and the payment gateway is not experiencing any problems. 

Read the payouts policy for more details.

## **What if I missed my deadline?**

Oversight reserves the right to absorb your funds and NOT trigger any disbursements at all if you couldn't complete the target within the specified timeline.

**In short, you won't get any portion of your raised money if you couldn't complete the target before allowed deadline.**

## How can I ensure my donations are being used responsibly by the authors?

Users have the option of publishing regular progress reports on their projects clearly stating how far have they come in their projects and how much progress they have made. You can read these reports for by navigating to **reports** section in the sidebar that shows on every project page. Frequency of publishing these reports is solely depended on the user. 

Some users also attach external links containing their project's latest data or images in the **repository** field of their projects, which can be accessed by clicking on the **data-repository button** on project's main content page.

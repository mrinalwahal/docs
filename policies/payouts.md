# Payouts

Oversight shall automatically disburse your funds once the total donations/sponsorship received on your project have hit your specified target. This is referred as All-Or-Nothing model i.e. no intermediate payouts are issues before you hit your funding target for a specific project.

You shall automatically receive a congratulatory email from Oversight within 48 hours of you hitting your funding target, on a per project basis. This email shall mark that we have acknowledged your target is complete and have initiated the disbursement of your funds.

How long it takes for funds to be deposited in your account also depends on your bank's processing time. Also, is must be clear that **no payouts are issues on bank/national/regional holidays in India.**

_Disclaimer: Oversight only supports sponsorship for projects published by **Indian residents**, therefore, if you have mistakenly been allowed to raise funds for your project \(unless Oversight has issues announcements for international operations\), Oversight is not responsible for disbursing your funds, since it goes against our policies. **You have been warned.**_

Your bank account will be the preferred option for initiating payouts to, since VPA \(UPI\) accounts have an upper limit as per governmental regulations. However, if the total payout falls within the permitted limit specified by the government of India, or Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\), then VPA account shall be preferred for the payout.

Therefore, it is advised to have your bank account attached as the funding account on your Oversight profile, to make things easier and safer.

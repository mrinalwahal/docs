  drastically increase your chances of acceptance by authors on Oversight.

# Proposals

## Title

Be straightforward and proper with the title of the proposal and write it in bold. Title can depend on what you are proposing on the particular project. For example, for a project using a novel engineering technique, if you are proposing a new/improved method to enhance some feature of the project, a supposed title of your proposal could be, "Optimizing the XYZ algorithm for \[project title\]."

Similarly, if you are sending a proposal to become an intern on a project, your title could be - "Internship Proposal for XYZ Project."

### Contact Details

Write it just under the title. Clearly mention your email, phone number \(optional\) and any other location where the author can reach out to you. Also, clearly mention author's full name and their oversight handle \(username\).

Also, clearly mention the complete URL of the project you are submitting the project for. Simply copy-paste the URL of the project from browser. It should be in form of **oversight.in/{username}/{project-slug}**.

## Problem Statement/Subject

Explain the problem you are offering to solve, in detail. The ideal word limit is 70-100 words. Very briefly mention the final solution you would deliver in 1-2 lines \(max\). If you are applying for a job on the project, you can treat this as a subject of a job application and make it, "Applying for XYZ role on XYZ project."

## Objective

Explain the primary aim of your collaboration with the author on that particular project. Don't explain the solution you are offering here itself. That will come later in the proposal. Keep it below 200 words. Don't make it into a story. Simply mention what you hope to achieve at the end of the project.

## Rationale

Simply mention what is the logic behind the solution you are offering or the significance of your solution. Explain the most interesting portions of your proposed collaboration and how do they connect to improving the final product. Keep it below 250 words.

## Approach

Explain the step by step process of how you aim to achieve the final objectives you have set. Everything should be crystal clear. You don't have to write with certainty since you can be unclear on what course would the future collaboration take with the author on that project, but you can write the expected approach in accordance with the objectives you have set for the final stage.

## Deliverables

Mention all the final deliverables you can promise the author. Write it in a numbered list. Deliverables need not always be the final product of the project itself, but compartmentalized modules that you will work on during the course of your entire proposed collaboration.

For example, on a project that aims to make crowdfunding platform like Oversight, one of your deliverables could be working on and completing the APIs required for incorporating the payment gateway on the website. Or preparing the deployment infrastructure for the platform.

## Timeline

Write a detailed planned schedule on week-by-week basis clearly mentioning what do you expect to achieve each week. Mention the deadline by wich you expect to achieve all your objectives and submit all your deliverables. Mention some checkpoints/milestones as well. For example, after 2-3 weeks of development, you might want to conduct first stage testing of at least one of your deliverables. Write it in a tabular form, if possible. It looks neat.

## References

If you have mentioned any text or links in your proposal from any external sources, simply mention those references. Same way you do for a research paper. Nothing fancy, just copy-paste the reference links if you want.

## Possible Issues \(Optional\)

If you feel you are uncertain about certain sections of your planned collaboration, or unsure about some technical details of the project, be honest and mention where you feel you may get stuck and may need author/mentor's help in resolving the issue. Doesn't matter how small or irrelevant you feel your doubt might be, being open and honest with the authors is always good, since they feel you have put extra time in designing the proposal and appreciate you spending time to actually put a deep thought into their project.

## Personal Details

#### How will you and the authors keep in contact?

If your collaboration is remote and you don't need to, or you don't plan to, physically visit the workplace/laboratory, mention all the possible ways you can stay in contact with the authors and keep them updated of the progress. 

We are writing a proper guide on best practices users can employ to a thoroughly professional and sophisticated collaboration proposal and increase their chances of response from the authors.

#### Why do you want to do this project?

Explain the primary motivation behind collaborating on this particular project. Enlighten the authors about what is driving you. Don't get too emotional and take it a bit easy. The ideal word limit is below 350 words.

#### Why should they accept YOU?

Be open, present yourself honestly and with utmost humility and obedience. Tell the authors about something youâ€™ve worked on in the past that would make you a good candidate for this project.

#### Working Time and Commitments

Tell the authors openly, will you be working full-time on this? If not, how much time can you commit? Don't make overarching promises which you can't keep. Being honest about your commitments if what keeps the quality of engagement high on Oversight. Make sure you can commit to what you promise.

#### Resume \(Important\)

Remember to attach your resume at the end of your proposal document. If you tailor your resume exclusively with your experiences and skills relevant to the particular project in question, it can significantly increase your chances of acceptance.

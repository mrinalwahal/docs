# Payouts

## Payout Disbursement For Every Other Entity Except Projects  <a id="empowerments"></a>

Users can withdraw their total collected wallet balance anytime they wish, if they have a minimum balance of Rs. 1,000 \(INR\) in their wallets. As soon as they wthdraw the balance, a payout is automatically initiated.

The amount is disbursed in the funding \(UPI\) account saved in their wallet. Users can update this account in the "wallet settings" page inside their Oversight account.

Users can also track the status of their payout settlements from the "wallet settings" page in their Oversight profile.

{% hint style="info" %}
If total withdrawal amount is above Rs. 45,000, then we issue multiple settlements in batches. This is due to Govt. of India's upper limit on UPI transactions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for payouts to work, your Funding Account \(UPI\) must be updated in your account settings, otherwise we will not be able to disburse your collected funds into your account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oversight is also not responsible for any incorrect UPI account details saved by the any user. If you \(or any user\) saved incorrect UPI details and all the user's funds got disbursed into that account, Oversight cannot be held liable and would also not be responsible for recovering the funds. Therefore, please be very careful while saving your UPI details in your account settings.
{% endhint %}

## Payout Disbursement For Projects

Once you have finally **hit your funding target OR the project has reached its funding deadline** \(set by you/user whilst publishing the project\), you will get the option of withdrawing your funds from the same project page. Clicking on that option/button will generate a unique payout link, which will open up in the current browser, and will also be sent to your registered mobile and email.

In that link, you can add your bank account or UPI details, wherever you would like to receive your funds. Upon submission of that form, your payout will automatically be scheduled for our next disbursement cycle.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oversight is not responsible for any incorrect account details filled by users. Make sure that this can transfer the funds to an incorrect account or may permanently halt/corrupt your payout, and the you \(the user\) may never receive your collected funds. In either case, Oversight doesn't stand responsible for the same.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is the duty of the user to keep logging into their Oversight account and ensure whether the project has raised sufficient funds to fulfill its target or not. Although, Oversight will also send an email once any project hits its funding target.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
How long it takes for funds to be deposited in your account also depends on your bank's processing time. Also, is must be clear that **no payouts are issued on bank/national/regional holidays in India.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Disclaimer:** Oversight only supports sponsorship for projects published by **Indian residents**, therefore, if you have mistakenly been allowed to raise funds for your project despite not being an Indian resident/citizen \(unless Oversight has issued announcements for international operations\), Oversight is not responsible for disbursing your funds, since it goes against our policies. **You have been warned.**
{% endhint %}

## Deadlines For Projects

Users can manually select their preferred deadline date when publishing a new project, on which they'd like funding on that project to complete or cease to continue beyond.

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Deadlines are not changeable.
2. Fees charges on your payout amount, if you couldn't complete your funding target before the deadline, would be different \(generally higher\) than the default fees charged on every project's payout if you do complete/achieve your funding target before the deadline. Read pricing policy for more details.

## Halting Disbursements

Oversight regularly updates it's policy on what kind of projects, or projects pertaining to which field, what intentions and/or what objectives will be allowed to be published and funded on its platform. As of now, there is no restriction on which kind of projects can be funded. It's an open ground and a wild west for every passionate researcher/developer out there.

However, Oversight reserves the right to un-publish or delete any project from its platform if it seems problematic to Oversight. These could be projects pertaining to Weapons Engineering, or dangerous neuro-scientific experimentation, amongst other reasons. 

Beyond that, Oversight also reserves the right to block or permanently halt disbursements/settlements, for reasons pertaining to errors in documentation or records maintained that of the user or their projects. The easiest way to negotiate the release of funds with Oversight in such a scenario is to comply with any/every recovery method that Oversight describes to users in that case.

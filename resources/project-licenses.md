# Project Licenses

Considering a lot of researchers are often concerned about intellectual property rights of/on their projects and hesitate to either publish the projects to raise funds or are uncomfortable in putting out proper details/metadata pertaining to their project, Oversight is working on releasing its own standard licenses which can be attached and applied to published projects for free.

This is an attempt to decrease the concerns of researchers pertaining to IPR issues. We'll inform you as soon as we release these licenses.

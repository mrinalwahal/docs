# FAQ

## Why do you need KYC?

You can use all the free features without KYC, including publishing level 0 public posts, as well as make transactions on other authors' profiles for entity, be it empowerments, or payments for lectures and resources, however, to start accepting payments on your own profile you need to do the KYC due to govt regulations.

## How can I withdraw my earned funds?

Simply go to your "wallet settings" from the header, and click on "withdraw" button. It will initiate a payout to your saved funding account \(UPI\) ID in the same wallet settings \(which you can update anytime you want as well\).

And you can track your issued settlements in the "settlements" table just below your wallet settings.

You can read about our payouts policy in detail.

## I've reached the funding target on project crowd-funding. How long until I receive my funds?

Congratulations on hitting your target! If you have already scheduled the payout from the project page, then it can take up to 3-5 working days for the funds to arrive in your account, provided there are no national/bank holidays and the payment gateway is not experiencing any problems.

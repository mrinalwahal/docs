  only.

# Dark Only

Being purely born out of hands of engineers, Oversight remains true to its origins, and aims to provides all applications of our ecosystem with a dark theme only \(except this documentation\).

Despite numerous requests, our developers constantly aim to render our dark styling and templates as warm and readable to a normal and stable eye as possible. 

Perhaps in the future Oversight may deploy thee choice of providing certain components on the platform in a light \(or much lighter\) theme. But the base of platforms shall remain dark. Just like our maid's humour. :\)

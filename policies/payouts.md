# Payouts

## Deadlines For Projects

Maximum 6 months, from the date of publishing of the project, is the default deadline of every project for every Rs. 1,00,000 compartment of total target.

* For targets up to 1,00,000, deadline is 6 months maximum.
* Similarly, 12 months for targets up to 2,00,000.
* And so on, until a maximum target value of Rs. 25,00,000.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since, deadlines are decided upon compartments rounded of to Rs. 1,00,000, **deadline for a hypothetical target of Rs. 1,20,000 would also be 12 months.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Deadlines are not changeable.
2. You won't get any portion of your raised money if you missed your given deadline.
{% endhint %}

## Payout Disbursement For Projects

Once you have finally **hit your funding target and provided that the project has not crossed its funding deadline**, you will get the option of withdrawing your funds from the same project page. Clicking on that option/button will generate a unique payout link, which will open up in the current browser, and will also be sent to your registered mobile and email.

In that link, you can add your bank account or UPI details, wherever you would like to receive your funds. Upon submission of that form, your payout will automatically be scheduled for our next disbursement cycle.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oversight is not responsible for any incorrect account details filled by users. Make sure that this can transfer the funds to an incorrect account or may permanently halt/corrupt your payout, and the you \(the user\) may never receive your collected funds. In either case, Oversight doesn't stand responsible for the same.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is the duty of the user to keep logging into their Oversight account and ensure whether the project has raised sufficient funds to fulfill its target or not. Oversight is not responsible for informing the user personally for the same. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
How long it takes for funds to be deposited in your account also depends on your bank's processing time. Also, is must be clear that **no payouts are issued on bank/national/regional holidays in India.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Disclaimer:** Oversight only supports sponsorship for projects published by **Indian residents**, therefore, if you have mistakenly been allowed to raise funds for your project despite not being an Indian resident/citizen \(unless Oversight has issued announcements for international operations\), Oversight is not responsible for disbursing your funds, since it goes against our policies. **You have been warned.**
{% endhint %}

## Preferred Account

Your bank account will be the preferred option for initiating payouts to, since VPA \(UPI\) accounts have an upper limit on transactions as per governmental regulations. However, if the total payout falls within the permitted transaction limit specified by the Government of India, or Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\), then VPA account should not cause any problems.

## Payout Disbursement For Empowerments <a id="empowerments"></a>

Total payout equal to the complete sum of all subscriptions amount charged for a particular month's cycle are disbursed at the end of the month, after deducting the aforementioned fees.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for empowerments to work, your Funding Account \(UPI\) must be updated in your account settings, otherwise we will not be able to disburse your collected funds into your account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Oversight is also not responsible for any incorrect UPI account details saved by the any user. If you \(or any user\) saved incorrect UPI details and all the user's funds got disbursed into that account, Oversight cannot be held liable and would also not be responsible for recovering the funds. Therefore, please be very careful while saving your UPI details in your account settings.
{% endhint %}

## Halting Disbursements

Oversight regularly updates it's policy on what kind of projects, or projects pertaining to which field, what intentions and/or what objectives will be allowed to be published and funded on its platform. As of now, there is no restriction on which kind of projects can be funded. It's an open ground and a wild west for every passionate researcher/developer out there.

However, Oversight reserves the right to un-publish or delete any project from its platform if it seems problematic to Oversight. These could be projects pertaining to Weapons Engineering, or dangerous neuro-scientific experimentation, amongst other reasons. 

Beyond that, Oversight also reserves the right to block or permanently halt disbursements i.e. decide against disbursing collected/raised funds by any user/author on any of their projects, for reasons pertaining to errors in documentation or records maintained that of the user or their projects. The easiest way to negotiate the release of funds with Oversight in such a scenario is to comply with any/every recovery method that Oversight describes to users in that case.

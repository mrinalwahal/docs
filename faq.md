# FAQ

## When will I get my money?

We will automatically disburse your funds once the total sponsorship received on your project have hit your specified target. This is referred as All-Or-Nothing model i.e. no intermediate payouts are issued before you hit your funding target for a specific project.

You can read about our [payouts policy](https://docs.oversight.in/policies/payouts) in detail.

## Where will I get my money?

In your account settings, there's a section reserved for **funding account.** We strongly advise you to update the latest details of the preferred bank account in which you would like to receive your funds. Do remember that in case, you have not updated your funding account details, we will not be able to disburse your funds even after you hit your targets. This can unnecessarily delay the disbursement. 

To know which type of bank account is preferable, read the [payouts policy](https://docs.oversight.in/policies/payouts).

## I've reached the target. How long until I receive my funds?

Congratulations on hitting your target! We'll initiate your disbursement within 48 hours of touching your targets. Just make sure you have updated the latest details of your funding account in your account settings. If you haven't added your funding account until now, do add it immediately, since we'll be releasing the funds in that account. In case, you haven't added any account yet, we won't be able to disburse the money. 

Read the [payouts policy](https://docs.oversight.in/policies/payouts) for more details.

## Why can't I simply use a password to login?

In order to provide improved security, Oversight employs TOTP based authentication. Post registration of a new account, you will have to scan the issued barcode/QR-Code in your respective authenticator mobile apps \(recommended: Google Authenticator\). Once the barcode is scanned, the authenticator app will start generating OTP refreshed in every 30 seconds, You can use these OTP codes at any time instead of passwords during your login.
